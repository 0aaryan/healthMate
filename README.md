# HealthMate Chat üè•

Welcome to HealthMate Chat, a personalized health advice application powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo! This application allows users to interact with a virtual health advisor, providing health advice based on user input and personalized health data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before running the application, make sure you have Python installed. You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### OpenAI API Key
You need to obtain an OpenAI API key to use the language model. Create a copy of `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`. Replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key.

## Running the Application
To run the HealthMate Chat application, execute the following command:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

## Usage

#### Read from Arduino
If you have an Arduino device, you can integrate it to read health data. (Integration details to be added)

### Add Field
You can add new health data fields by providing a name and value. Fields must not already exist to be added.
