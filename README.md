# HealthMate: Smart Sensor in Healthcare

## Overview

HealthMate is a comprehensive health monitoring system that integrates real-time data from a KY028 temperature sensor and a KY039 heart rate sensor. The system utilizes an Arduino board for data acquisition, a Python-based Streamlit framework for the user interface, and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo for personalized health advice.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with HealthMate, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Arduino IDE: [Download Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- Python 3.x: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Pip (Python Package Installer): Included with Python 3.x installation

## Hardware Setup

### Arduino Connection

1. Connect the Arduino board to your computer via USB.
2. Open the Arduino IDE.
3. Load the Arduino code from `arduino_code.ino`.
4. Select the correct board model and port from the "Tools" menu.
5. Click "Upload" to upload the code to the Arduino board.

### Sensor Connections

1. Connect the KY028 temperature sensor to the designated pins on the Arduino board.
2. Connect the KY039 heart rate sensor to the specified pins.

## Software Setup

### Arduino Code Upload

1. Ensure the Arduino IDE is open with the correct code loaded.
2. Select the correct board model and port from the "Tools" menu.
3. Click "Upload" to upload the code to the Arduino board.

### Python Script Execution

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add the following:

    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    ```

    Replace `your_openai_api_key` with your actual OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo API key.

5. Run the Python script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuously monitors heart rate and temperature data in real-time.
- **AI-Driven Health Advice:** Provides personalized health advice using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo.
- **Dynamic Chat Interface:** Engage in a dynamic chat interface for interactive communication.
- **Manual and Automated Data Entry:** Flexibility for users to enter data manually or read data from the Arduino sensor.

## Usage

### Manual Data Entry

1. Launch the Streamlit application by running `python main.py`.
2. Enter health data manually via the user interface.
3. Interact with the AI for personalized health advice.

### Automated Data Reading

1. Connect the Arduino board as described in the [Hardware Setup](#hardware-setup) section.
2. Launch the Streamlit application by running `python main.py`.
3. Select "Read from Arduino" in the sidebar.
4. Enter the duration for data reading and click "Start Reading."
5. The system will read data from the Arduino sensor and update health parameters.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during setup or usage, refer to the [Troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) guide for common problems and solutions.
